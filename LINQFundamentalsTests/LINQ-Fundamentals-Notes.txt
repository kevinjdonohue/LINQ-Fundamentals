Motivation:  Make data access easier in .NET languages.

"Integrating data queries into C# has been a goal for years"

Data Impedance Mismatch
===================================

Typical data access challenges:

1.  Different data types
2.  Different data sources
3.  Relationships vs. Hierarchies (ex. relational data vs. XML data)
4.  Limited Intellisense, syntax, language, etc. support for data access

Manipulating Data
===================================

Problem:
The data source generally determines the API and the tools to use:

Object Data:

Generics
Algorithms

Relational Data:

ADO.NET
SQL

XML Data:

XmlDocument
XPATH / XSLT

Solution:
LINQ - Language Integrated Query - provides general-purpose query facilities for all types of data



Digging Into C# Features for LINQ
===================================

topics:

Extension Methods
Lambda Expressions
Expression Trees
Query Expressions
Type Inference
Anonymous Types
Partial Methods


2 ways to write LINQ queries:

1.  LINQ comprehension
2.  Extension or Lambda expression


Extension Methods - add what appear to be "new" instance methods on an existing type
